<h2 class="nobreak" id="95_PERFECT">“95% PERFECT”</h2>
</div>

<p>This phrase was used by a writer several decades ago
to describe the dwelling house architecture of the old town
of Nantucket, and since then has been generally accepted.
It symbolizes the state of mind of most people who come to
this remote island town, traverse its streets and view its
houses. They all sense that there is something in the mass
or total of dwelling houses that is different from what they
are accustomed to elsewhere. The effect is pervading, pleasing
and peaceful. It causes them to picture a town of years
ago remaining unchanged by the march of time.</p>

<p>Many of us instinctively realize in part the causes of
this strong and lasting impression.</p>

<p>First—The dwellings are mostly located close to the
street, often directly on the edge of the sidewalk. They are
not set back with yards or lawns in front.</p>

<p>Second—The breadth of the house usually occupies
much of the lot so that adjacent houses are but a few feet,
often a few inches, apart. The gardens, as well as the
flapping clothes lines, the additions and the extensions, are
at the rear; usually out of sight from the street. These rear
(and side) ells and projections are a general characteristic
of the old houses. Similar new additions if done in the proper
way, with gable roofs or lean-to roofs, can be most pleasing.</p>

<p>Third—Uniformity in architectural type, style, material
and colors, within a limited range, is quite general and more
responsible than any other single feature for the exceptional
and unique ensemble. Elsewhere, in the off-islander’s hometown,
each block or section is apt to have a medley of types,
perhaps in close proximity—as an original colonial house
and in succession a bungalow, a mid-Victorian and then a
Georgian mansion, a gingerbread pattern house of the 1880
period, followed by a woman’s magazine suburban type, and
perhaps many others. Each may be very good of its kind and
suit the taste of its owner and belong in certain places. But
the appeal at Nantucket is in not having enough of these
varying styles to spoil the picture; hardly enough to mar it,
in the old part of the town.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PERIODS">PERIODS</h2>
</div>


<p>The architecture of the dwellings of Nantucket may
be divided into three periods:</p>

<p>The English mode of the settlers. This is the early
Colonial; the lean-to type. Say, from the time of building
the first houses up to about 1740.</p>

<p>The next arbitrary division is the architecture of the
Colonial and early Federal times, approximately, as far as
Nantucket is concerned, dating from prior to the Revolutionary
War to about 1830. Most of our old dwellings belong
in this division.</p>

<p>Finally, the Classic period. Commencing about 1830
and continuing to about 1860, after which there was not
much building of consequence of any dwellings which need
to be considered here.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="Doing_Over">
DOING OVER OLD HOUSES<br>
</h2>
</div>


<p>Each year people from off-island, yielding to the lure
of Nantucket, buy old houses, or occasionally build new ones,
for seasonal occupancy. For many such the season is lengthening
year by year. The spring and fall are glorious in this
island climate. The diversions and occupations many and
amply absorbing.</p>

<p>Such people almost invariably want an “old” house.
From an investment viewpoint alone an old or old-style
house sells or rents much more readily and for higher prices
than a modern-type structure. Many prospective customers
will not look at the latter.</p>

<p>There is a surprisingly large number of competent
local carpenter-builders, masons, painters, plumbers and
electricians resident on the Island. They can undertake
and properly execute practically any work that is likely
to be specified. Many of them are glad to assist in carrying
out the old Nantucket traditions, but there have been some
who frankly had no love for the old; building a house for
themselves they would abandon every old feature; there have
been a few with very unique ideas of what they call “antique;”
so it is essential that strict care be exercised in making additions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
or building new structures to see that the right designs
and details are both adopted and executed.</p>

<p>How can this much desired end be accomplished? It
has been suggested that an illustrated book with simple
analysis and exposition of this subject would help. This book
is an endeavor to be of such assistance.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="Analysis">
ANALYSIS<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p>We herein concern ourselves only with the visible exteriors
of dwelling houses as viewed from the street. The
interiors of the houses and their furnishings are not treated;
nor shops nor public buildings. It will be apparent also that
this is not written for the architects, particularly those experienced
in Nantucket traditions (there are such).</p>

<p>We will not make the customary historical approach
to our subject. It would over-emphasize what is not the
primary purpose. Thus we are not concerned with the
following:</p>

<p>The temporary shelters built at Madaket about 1659.</p>

<p>The houses of the very first town. These were located
at and in the vicinity of Capaum Harbour (now Pond) and
Hummock Pond, on the north shore about one and a half
miles from the present town. Only one, a lean-to type,
remains.</p>

<p>Such of these houses or portions thereof which were
taken down and removed to what is now the town of Nantucket.</p>

<p>The oldest remaining house, a lean-to dated 1686.</p>

<p>The one brick of the last quarter of the 18th century
on Orange Street.</p>

<p>The seven brick houses of the second quarter of the
19th century with parapet brick end gables (six on Main
Street and one on Pleasant Street). Also a number of large
houses or mansions of about the same period built of wood.</p>

<p>The two of temple columned type on Main Street.</p>

<p>The one classical type on Orange Street.</p>

<p>These houses are the frosting on the cake but they
are not the cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
They are all of great interest and will be viewed later
herein, but they are too few to constitute the picture of
Nantucket town as a whole, which consists of about 400 old
houses.</p>

<p>Then what are the kinds of houses which do constitute
our old Nantucket? To find out, we have taken a census which
analyzes each house on all or much of the length of most of
the streets in the old sections, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: Union, Main to Flora;
Orange, Main to Lyon; Fair, the entire length; Pleasant,
Main to and including Moors End; Middle Main, Fair to
the Monument; Upper Main, Monument to head of the
street; Gardner, Main to Liberty; Liberty, near Centre to
Gardner; Pearl, near Centre to North Liberty; Centre, Gay
to West Chester; Lily, Centre to North Liberty; Academy
Lane, Centre to Westminster; Gay, Centre to Westminster;
Hussey, Centre to North Liberty; Quince, Centre to Westminster.</p>

<p>Omitted from this census are the thirty-six acres of the
central district which were completely burned out by the
conflagration of 1846 and therefore contain no structures
over ninety years of age. It then, as now, included all of the
business section. Many of the stores, as on Centre Street,
were rebuilt quickly in an intended temporary manner, but
the decline of the whaling industry and its attendant prosperity
coinciding with this time, much of the temporary
remained permanent. Fortunately, the numerous new styles
had not arrived in 1846 and many of the dwellings built anew
in the burned area were in the old taste, attractive and dignified.
This area was bounded approximately by</p>

<ul>
<li>South Wharf and Salem Street,</li>
<li>Both sides of Main, Union to Orange,</li>
<li>Both sides of Centre, Rose Lane to Broad Street,</li>
<li>Both sides of Broad, Centre to <abbr title="North">No.</abbr> Water (excluding Ocean House),</li>
<li>Both sides of North Water, Broad to Ash and Sea,</li>
<li>Eastward from all the above to the harbor.</li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">Our drawing, <a href="#i024">numbered 17</a>, shows the outline of this conflagration
district.</p>

<h2>
CENSUS<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p>The purpose is to analyze each house in respect to a
considerable number of predominant features so as to arrive
at totals which will indicate the prevailing characteristics of
the old houses. These are exterior features on the front
of the house or conspicuously visible from the street.</p>

<p>In these old districts we have tabulated 319 old dwellings,
interspersed with 46 of modern or mixed design. As
this includes about two-thirds of the old houses, it is representative
of the whole as the rest are known to be of the
same types.</p>

<p>Here is the list of features and the number of times
each was recorded:</p>


<ul>
<li>Walls—wood 311; brick 8.</li>

<li>Exterior Surface of Front Wall—shingles 179; clapboards 132; brick 8.</li>

<li>Exposed Foundations—brick 246; stone 65; modern replacements 8.</li>

<li>Height of Foundation above Ground, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, height of first floor above ground—</li>

<li class="i5">High (generally with 3 or 4 panes of glass vertically in basement windows) 140.</li>

<li class="i5">Low (generally 1 or 2 steps to first floor; without basement windows) 97.</li>

<li class="i5">Intermediate (between high and low) 82.</li>

<li>Number of Stories—two 271; one and one-half 30; one 16; three 2.</li>

<li>Roof Type—gable 287; lean-to 19; hip 8; gambrel 5.</li>

<li>Windows—total panes of glass in the two sashes—twelve 216; twenty-four 49; eighteen 4.</li>

<li class="i3">Modern <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, two or four 50.</li>

<li>Dormers in front roof—the narrow gable roof, old type 29; wide or with shed roof 23.</li>

<li>Roof Walks—35 Cupolas—14 Front Roof Balustrades—11.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></li>

<li>Door Location—toward one side of the front 227; at center of front 92.</li>

<li>Chimney Location—central 132; to one side of center 109; near side of building 78.</li>

<li class="i5">Main chimneys were always of brick, generally with six or less flues, now plastered or painted above roof and located at or near the ridge at interior of building.</li>

<li>Modern Detractions—noted occasionally in the 319 old houses:</li>

<li class="i3">Modern windows of four or two sheets of glass—50</li>

<li class="i3">Modern piazza or porch, generally with flat roof—51</li>

<li class="i3">Modern front door—odd panels, golden oak, plate glass, etc.—46</li>

<li class="i3">Modern bay window—35</li>

<li class="i3">Slim chimneys—23</li>

<li class="i3">Hood over front door with fancy gingerbread detail—13</li>

<li class="i3">Large lattice arbor obscuring front door—8</li>

<li class="i3">Conspicuous “sun parlors”—12</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features. It was gratifying to observe that the following did not appear at all on the old houses or with sufficient frequency to note:</p>

<ul>
<li class="i3">Fancy shingles—as in belts on walls and roofs or scalloped or diamond-shaped</li>

<li class="i3">Outside chimneys—including those of cobblestone</li>

<li class="i3">Gingerbread trim—except on hoods over front doors</li>

<li class="i3">Cement blocks—particularly those professing to simulate artificial stone</li>

<li class="i3">Conspicuous cement steps and walks to front door</li>

<li class="i3">Modern brick—such as the yellow and tapestry varieties</li>

<li class="i3">Conspicuous bright paint colors—particularly on blinds and doors</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TYPICAL_HOUSE">THE TYPICAL HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p>The conclusions from this analysis are inescapable, although
they may never have occurred to us, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:</p>

<p>The vast majority of old Nantucket houses are of one
type. Therefore it is this type that must largely make the
picture of the town. This is it:</p>

<p>Wood walls, covered with shingles or clapboards, with
the shingles weathered gray or painted. The colors of
shingles (when painted) and of clapboards and trim are
white, cream, gray, yellow or brown. White predominates.
The exterior window and front door blinds (shutters) are
painted dark green.</p>

<p>Basement is high with walls of brick, painted or plastered
and with windows of considerable size in these walls.
This high basement is a distinctly Nantucket characteristic.</p>

<p>Or to a somewhat less extent, the basement is low to
the ground or somewhat so without any or sizeable cellar
windows.</p>

<p>The house is two stories in height with attic.</p>

<p>Roof is gable type without dormers. The pitch of the
gable roof is generally 9”, to 12” horizontal measurement
but not less than 8” pitch.</p>

<p>The chimney is brick, plastered or painted gray, massive,
usually containing six flues, located near the ridge and at
the center or to one side of the center.</p>

<p>The front door is at one side of the center of the front
or, less frequently, at the center.</p>

<p>Windows are of two sashes (with 12 to 24 lights to a
window), <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, from 6 to 12 lights to a sash. 12 to a window
predominates on the front.</p>

<p>Such is our typical house.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the recognized old style variations
from this predominant type are out of order. Far from
it. Most excellent are low ledgestone foundations with or
without plaster covering. One story, one and a half story

<p>Referring to that marked <a href="#i015">Nos. 1 to 9</a>, it will be observed
that <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1 shows the front and side of a lean-to house of
the 1st period. The settlers built lean-to houses. So did the
next generations. Houses of one story, of one and one-half
story and of two story height in front.</p>

<p>All the other houses on the page are of the 2nd period;
that is to say, the Colonial and early Federal times. It is
obvious they are a natural development from the lean-to
house.</p>

<p>All have gable roofs except <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 8 with gambrel roof,
and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 9 with hip roof.</p>

<p>Drawing <a href="#i016"><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 10</a> shows a low basement house, with
correct front door panels, lean-to projection and two-story
ell.</p>

<p><a href="#i017"><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 11</a> is the more frequently found variety of the
old houses, having the high basement peculiar to Nantucket,
an off-side front door and center-central massive chimney.
Note the wooden down spout conductors and four pane high,
basement windows.</p>

<p><a href="#i019"><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 13.</a> Here we see the correct small, gable roof,
dormer windows and the walk at the roof ridge, access to
which was gained through a trap door (skylight).</p>

<p><a href="#i020">Nos. 14</a> and <a href="#i021">15.</a> These illustrate the plank frames of
windows. Observe the projection of the planks from the
face of wall. These are an essential to a Nantucket house of
old type.</p>

<p class="center">Drawing <a href="#i022"><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 16</a></p>


<p>This shows what was once a perfect Nantucket house
but successive owners have altered it till nothing of the
original remains in view except two windows. Somebody
raised the house and used artificial stone cement blocks in
the foundations as well as in the battlemented steps to the
piazza which has giant columns resting on miniature anti-rot
pipe supports holding up a large flat roof which but partly
conceals a huge exterior cobblestone chimney.</p>

<p>Cement steps and galvanized iron pipe hand rails lead
up to the golden oak front door containing a large beveled
plate glass, all surmounted by a hood held up by supporting
brackets of jig-saw design.</p>

<p>A belt of fancy scalloped and diamond-shaped shingles
extends across the front wall and large sheets of glass replace
the small window panes. There is a large bay window.</p>

<p>At the far side a “sun parlor” transforms that end of
the structure and a wide shed roof dormer completely
changes the main roof.</p>

<p>We do not intend to comment adversely on these
changes in respect to their individual merits, our purpose
being to point out that one cannot make them and retain
an old house.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ALTERATIONS">ALTERATIONS</h2>
</div>


<p>We have a precious inheritance in this large group of
old houses. Every effort should be made to keep from harming
them when making changes, and to keep from building
dissimilar types of new houses in the old built-up sections.
There is ample room outside of the old districts or elsewhere
on the Island for those who determine to build a place of
modern appearance. Yet one can ride a hobby too hard. The
complete purist is often impracticable. One living in an old
house wants to be comfortable and to have adequate space.
There is hardly an old house in town which has not on its
visible exterior—at least somewhere on its four sides—the
marks of modernizing as made by succeeding generations.
Fortunately the fronts as a rule have been but little marred.</p>

<p>Nantucket can be kept “95% perfect” only by not
adding to the visible detractions on its old houses, and by not
building new types amidst the old. Thus this priceless
inheritance will be preserved—and incidentally the values
increased—as such houses become less and less procurable
here and elsewhere. We even venture to hope some of the
present detractions will be removed as time goes on.</p>

<p>So far as more room and modern comforts are concerned,
an architect or builder knowing his old Nantucket
can usually plan to provide them in “doing over” an old
house and still not harm its exterior. But all hope is lost if
the roof lines are spoiled by large shed-roof dormers or a
dormer room, and only less disfiguring are large “sun
parlors,” piazzas, exterior chimneys, or flat roofed ells or
projections, built where visible from the front.</p>

<p>To bring home what we mean—imagine that a conflagration
sweeps this town and destroys it. The land would
remain, the climate, sea bathing, sailing, outdoor and indoor
sports, and the moors. Inevitably, however, a part, probably
a small part, would be built up anew and there could be no
possible control of the styles. We would then have a small
village like any other modern one along the Atlantic seaboard,
entirely devoid of quaintness, charm or interest.
Nantucket would then be in its second decline, perhaps just
as severe as after the end of the whaling.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="EARLY_INFLUENCES">EARLY INFLUENCES</h2>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to contemplate what influenced our
prevailing architecture. First, as in many other affairs, it
was the almighty dollar. In the 18th century, and much of
the first quarter of the 19th, there was little spare cash
available on this Island. That which was accumulated, and
more, was needed for outfitting ships. Hence the houses were
built inexpensively and of moderate size.</p>

<p>Second, the Quakers put their indelible stamp on
Nantucket houses, particularly those built from 1750 to
1825. Worth tells us the Society of Friends reached its highest
tide of membership and influence on the Island a few
years prior to the opening of the 19th century. At this time
the population of Nantucket was about 5,600 and nearly
one-half attended Friends Meeting. The most potent cause
of the decline of Quakerism was the enforcement of their
discipline. They required utmost simplicity and utmost
plainness in detail of their houses. He recites an event which
took place as late as 1790, when Job Macy was building his
house on Mill Street. When his father discovered that the
plan was to erect a house of two stories, both front and rear,
without a lean-to and a long north sloping roof, he expostulated
with Job for the innovation and vowed that if the
house was built in the new style as proposed he would never
enter it, and tradition is that he never did. An incident of
the same nature and of about the same time is reported by
Hussey. When a certain house near Stone Alley was being
erected from frames made on the mainland, it was found to
be upright all around, the back two stories high like the front
and so without the regulation long back roof. To some of
the Islanders this caused uneasiness, as being likely to introduce
change and extravagance. A citizens’ meeting was
convened and the owner requested to cut down the back
posts. Good man as he was, he complied.</p>

<p>Third, relative affluence, when it came, was derived
from or had its origin in the sea. It was possessed by the
ship captains and ship owners. They were influenced by the
balance and carpentry of ships. This extended to their
dwellings. During the latter part of the prosperity period,
approximately from 1825 to 1860, some of these men had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
become merchants and capitalists. They enjoyed themselves
on shore and built the few mansions with which we are
familiar.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="DETAILS">DETAILS OF OLD HOUSES</h2>
</div>

<p>Back Side or Rear of Houses. Fortunately most of
these are not seen from the street, due to the proximity of
adjacent houses. This is the first place for extensions and
additions, such as a first floor kitchen with its small chimney,
more sleeping rooms, and if one must or needs, and the
compass points allow, a “sun parlor,” a columned piazza,
French doors, wide dormers, even (but we hope not) the
dormer room in the rear roof, and pergolas. If understanding
care is exercised, part of this can be well done.</p>

<p>Roof Coverings. Regret it as one may, but quite
properly under the fire ordinances, wood shingle roofs are
fast disappearing, with the shadow lines cast by the thick
shingle butts. It is, however, feasible to use individual non-inflammable
shingles of dark gray or black which are inconspicuous,
and if one has the price and inclination and
strength of rafters, an asbestos reproduction of old shingles,
absolutely faithful to type and attractive, is available and
should be employed, as see the house at 86 Centre Street.</p>

<p>White Trim. We venture to make note of the largely
prevailing present custom of painting white the exterior trim
of houses, including particularly the window casings, referring
only to the houses where the exterior walls are not
painted white but are of shingles, weathered gray. This has
the effect of outlining the windows and the edges of the
facades with extreme emphasis. Attention is directed to those
weathered gray shingled houses where, instead, the trim has
been painted in harmony and not in sharp contrast to the
gray. For this purpose some shades of gray paint have been
used, and in some of the older houses a dull brown. The
owner of such a gray shingled house, planning to re-paint
the exterior, should look at the examples referred to and
consider whether they would please his taste. In the early
days of paint a red color was used, doubtless appearing as
a dull reddish brown. In altering very old houses it has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
found on the exterior of the beveled boards which were the
outside of the wall when no shingles or clapboards were used.</p>

<p>Blinds. The louvered (slanted slat) blinds on exterior
walls at windows and front doors began to come into use
about 1840. They certainly do dress up a house but otherwise
have little or no use at Nantucket. A really old house
is in the best of taste without them and with a saving of
expense. Always (on an old house) they should be painted
a dark green. The earliest were quite heavy, without moveable
louvers. Most now in existence are lighter weight and usually
with tilting slats, an unnecessary provision. Solid paneled
shutters, general in many parts of the country, as at Philadelphia,
were not used at Nantucket.</p>

<p>Conductors. Fortunately, modern sheet metal down
spouts from gutters to take the water down to or under
ground are inconspicuous. They have been freely used to
replace the older spouts which have decayed. It is, however,
feasible, desirable and quite inexpensive to replace with
wooden down spouts of either circular or square section like
the originals.</p>

<p>Front Doorway. This opening into the house was
closed by a door of six raised panels with flush mouldings,
the topmost pair of panels small, and very seldom taken out
and replaced with glass. A characteristic of these doors was
that the middle rail was wide, almost 10”, with the bottom
rail much narrower. Many of the old doorways had no glass
about them, but as time advanced glass was used across the
top of the doorway, spoken of as a top light or transom, and
glass was employed vertically on either side of the door,
known as sidelights. Very infrequently at Nantucket the
muntins of the top light radiate from the center to either a
circular or oval top, known as a fanlight.</p>

<p>Architectural ornamentation on the exterior wall surrounding
the doorway, known as the frontispiece, was not
employed in the older houses, many of which had plain
plank frames with a header, but after the Revolution the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
frontispiece came more and more into use, but even then
was not highly ornate. Many frontispieces now seen on the
old houses were added in the period from 1800 to 1850 and
followed the designs in English architectural books. Recessed
doorways appeared in the classic period, accompanied by
fewer panels and heavier mouldings. Plain double-boarded
outside doors were undoubtedly used in the oldest houses.
Paneled doors appeared in Nantucket probably about 1730.</p>

<p>Entry. The modern name for this is vestibule. Reference
is to the enclosed projection over the front door
infrequently found on the old houses. This had a gable roof
and sometimes side windows. It generally entered directly
into the stairway hall or, in older times, into the kitchen.
It usually occurred that entries were not constructed with
the original house but added subsequently.</p>

<p>Windows. At Nantucket, prior to about 1720, leaded
panes were used. From then on to around 1790 small panes,
about 5” × 7”, were used with wooden muntins, and mostly
three lights wide. From about 1790 to about 1825 glass was
generally about 7” × 9” with 24 lights, except that many
narrow panes were used with less number of lights. Muntins
grew smaller as time advanced. From about 1825 on, 12
lights were mostly used, with 8” × 10” and 10” × 14” glass,
almost invariably 3 lights wide. The large panes (sheet glass)
came into general use soon after the Civil War, about 1865,
using one or two such panes to a sash. While our census
shows in the old houses a large proportion having but 12
panes to a front window, it is a fact that in a majority of
these houses part or all of the side windows and the rear
windows are apt to be of 24 panes. Therefore at some period
the front windows had been replaced to conform to the even
then changing mode and the improved financial status of
the owner, or frequently second-hand material was employed
in building a new house, when old multi-paned sash was used
at the rear and the sides while new 6-light sash were built for
the front.</p>

<p>Window frames on old houses were of plank and projected
from the wall. See drawings <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 14 and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 15. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
most important to faithfully continue this practice in all
alterations and new construction. The Nantucket carpenters
are accustomed to make such frames.</p>

<p>Roof Walks. You will observe from quotations of old
writings to be found later in this book that they were most
frequent. They are not today, our analysis showing but 35
in a total of 319 houses. It has been stated that after the decline
of whaling these walks were taken down when they got
out of repair and since they no longer served a useful purpose.
They were called “walks,” and for the purpose of identification
they are here spoken of as roof walks. How the late
William F. Macy decried their being called “captains’ walks”
or “widows’ walks!”</p>

<p>High Basements. The massive chimneys were frequently
of large area at the lowest level. This was for a bake
oven and cooking fireplace, located in the basement. These
basements extended several feet above and below the ground
level, with ample windows, generally four panes high, and
contained the kitchen, sometimes spoken of as the winter
kitchen. The basements were sheltered from the wind and
cold during the winter season.</p>

<p>Cupolas and Roof Balustrades. These were not employed
here until about 1800, mostly 1830 to 1860, and are
not much in evidence.</p>

<p>“95% Perfect.” Manifestly this was a generalization
to crystallize an impression, yet our census analysis of 365
houses in the old districts shows but 46 modern or mixed
type, intermingled; say 12½%. On the old houses we find
various added modern detractions, frequently several kinds
on one house, but many of them not serious. So let us
estimate that these old-district dwellings are still 85% perfect—an
astonishingly large percentage of unharmed oldness to
be found in this day and generation in over 400 closely
grouped houses. We have much to be thankful for.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DATED_HOUSES">DATED HOUSES</h2>
</div>

<p>Many exterior features assist in suggesting the approximate
date or origin of an old house and a knowledge of
what is behind the exterior would allow a more accurate
conclusion. But this information is not needed for our
purposes.</p>

<p>We would like to say, however, that fixing a precise
year date for the building of a house is most difficult here
in Nantucket, just as it has been found to be, for those
attempting to do so, in respect to old houses at off-island
locations. There is no evidence of building material being
derived from trees growing on this Island except by the
early settlers. Statements found in early writings speak of
house frames being brought from the mainland. There is
knowledge of much timber and lumber and shingles being
brought, principally from Maine, but also from New Hampshire
and Massachusetts. Packets made frequent voyages to
Maine in the early days. Even firewood was brought from
the mainland. Hence, second-hand building material was
saved and used again and even again, including window-sash
and doors. Houses were frequently moved in whole or in
part. There are many larger and more expensive houses
on the sites of smaller, older ones. Occasionally houses were
removed to make room for lawns and to give more light and
air to the remaining houses. In the years after the decline and
demise of the whaling industry, great numbers were taken
down and the material shipped away, often to distant points,
or used for local firewood. As an illustration, Messrs. George
C. Gardner and Allen Smith are reported to have taken
down some 270 houses during a decade or more after the
Civil War, many being sent to Cape Cod, at times cut into
bays and shipped on deck.</p>

<p>Old Deeds and Wills record a certain lot of land “with
house thereon.” Frequently, this causes the present-day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
owner to willingly assume that his present “house thereon”
is the same. The number of houses out of this 319, where
evidence could be adduced which would stand in a court of
law, showing the year in which the existing house was built,
are very few. But what of it, so long as we do not fool ourselves.
The error in fixing the precise date of the building
of a house is well described by Worth in Nant. Hist. Assn.
V. 2, Bul. 5, which might be read to advantage by those who
set much store in exact dates.</p>

<p>Simplicity, directness, proportion, balance and truth of
expression are the fundamentals of this architectural style.
In our modern, quantity production, machine age, with
forms and materials largely new and constantly changing, old

of rest, peace, comfort and constant delight.</p>

but are no more interesting, in their oldness, than the
much greater number which we regret not showing, due to
a limit of size for this book.</p>

<p>Here you will find houses of the three periods with all

<p>The architectural details desired are shown as viewed

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DESCRIPTIONS_OF_NANTUCKET">DESCRIPTIONS OF NANTUCKET</h2>
</div>

<p>The people for whom the old dwellings were built and
the conditions under which they lived were responsible for
the architecture.</p>

<p>Here are extracts from most of the older writings, and
some later ones, which writings should be read in full by
those interested.</p>

<p>1772—This is the date the author (Crevecoeur) of Letters
From An American Farmer, by J. Hector St. John, visited
this island. The “Letters” were written in English and first
published in London in 1782. There was a French edition
of 1784 and one of 1787. This is the earliest descriptive
writing of Nantucket with which we are familiar. It consists
of nearly one hundred pages, with a map, and should be
read entire by all who love their old Nantucket. Subsequent
articles and histories of the Island have not failed to make
use of what St. John wrote.</p>

<p>It is best to state that M. St. Jean de Crevecoeur may not
have been accurate in some details, as for instance the extent
to which building frames and foundations were brought
from the mainland. The writer of 1807 quoted hereinafter
says of St. John’s Letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>… “his pictures, though striking likenesses, are always
flattering. Another objection is that he is frequently
erroneous in minute and unimportant circumstances. He
gives the contour and character of the face exactly though,
as said before, in too favorable a light, but he makes strange
mistakes in the sleeve of a coat or the strap of a shoe. If the
reader has good nature enough to pardon these two faults,
he will peruse the Letters with perpetual delight.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following quotations are assembled from the
“Letters:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Island has nothing deserving of notice but its
inhabitants; here you meet with neither ancient monuments,
spacious halls, solemn temples nor elegant dwellings; not
a citadel nor any kind of fortification, not even a battery to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
rend the air. Their rural improvements are all of the most
simple and useful kind. Sherburn is the only town on the
Island, which consists of about 530 houses that have been
framed on the main. They are lathed and plastered within,
handsomely painted and boarded without. Each has a cellar
underneath, built with stones also fetched from the main.
They are all of a similar construction in appearance, plain
and entirely devoid of exterior or interior ornament. I observed
but one which was built of bricks, belonging to <span class="lock">Mr. ——,</span>
but like the rest it is unadorned. Quayes is a small
but valuable tract long since purchased by Mr. Coffin where
he has erected the best house on the Island. The differences
which I observed in the people are founded on nothing more
than the good or ill success of their maritime enterprises and
do not proceed from education. That is the same through
every class: simple, useful and unadorned, like their dress
and their houses. They are well acquainted with the cheapest
method of procuring lumber from the Kennebeck and Penobscot
Rivers. All their houses are neat, convenient and
comfortable. Some of them are filled with two families, for
when the husbands are at sea the wives require less house
room. Those who possess the greatest fortunes at present
belong to the Society of Friends. They yearly go to different
parts of this continent, constantly engaged in sea affairs.
Sometimes they have emigrated like bees. Some have settled
on the famous river Kennebeck, clearing the heaviest timbered
land in America, and instead of entirely consuming
their timber as we are obliged to do, some parts of it are
converted into useful articles for exportation, such as staves,
boards, hoops, barrels, etc. For that purpose they keep a
correspondence with their native island, and I know many of
the principal inhabitants of Sherburn, who though merchants
and living at Nantucket, yet possess valuable farms,
on that river, from whence they draw a great part of their
substance, meat, grain, firewood, etc. Yet there are not at
Nantucket so many wealthy people, after having considered
their great successes. The reason of this, I believe, is that
their island supplies the town with little or nothing (with few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
families excepted). Everyone must procure what they want
from the main. Here are neither Scotch, Irish nor French,
as in the case in most other settlements. They are an unmixed
English breed.”</p>

<p class="hanging">1791—By Walter Folger, <abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr>, dated Nantucket, May 21,
(<abbr title="Massachusetts Historical Society Collection">Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</abbr>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In 1790 the whole number of inhabitants was 4619.
They for the most part are a robust and enterprising people,
mostly seamen and mechanics. It is no strange thing to see
the same man occupy the station of a merchant, at other
times that of a husbandman or of a blacksmith or of a cooper
or of a number of other occupations.”</p>
</div>

<p class="hanging">1792—By Zaccheus Macy, dated Nantucket, 15th of 5th
mo. 1792 <a id="chg1">(<abbr title="Massachusetts Historical Society Collection">Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll.</abbr>)</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>“In the year 1659 Thomas Macy removed with his
family from Salisbury to the west end of the island to a place
called Madakit harbour. Thither came four from Martha’s
Vineyard for the sake of gunning and lived with them as
boarders. At that time there were near 3000 Indians on
Nantucket. They were willing to sell their land and the
English went on purchasing, beginning at the west end of
the island.”</p>
</div>

<p>Further on, Mr. Macy, alluding to the then (1792)
status of affairs on the island, states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“A great many of our most substantial men, lured by
the hope of large bounties, have moved from the island,
some to England, some to France and others to Halifax,
where they carry on the whale fishery. This is a great damage
to us. If these persons had carried away with them their part
of the poor it would have lightened our burden, for we now
have 215 widows, of whom not thirty are able to support
themselves without the assistance of friends and neighbors
and some are maintained by the town. We have besides a
great number of poor, but we have a considerable number
of able and industrious men who carry on the whale fishery.”</p>
</div>


<p class="hanging">1801—Josiah Quincy made a journey through the southeast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
parts of New England in 1801. He kept a diary
which is most interesting reading. (Mass. Hist. Soc.
Proc.) The following are brief quotations from it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The town of Nantucket appears from the harbor as
large as Salem but exhibits no marks of elegance or splendour.
With one or two exceptions they (the houses) are built
wholly of wood and have but two stories. By far the greater
number are without paint and with those which have it,
red is the predominant color. They are built generally upon
the street. The almost total want of trees, houses and fences
in the interior part of the island makes the road very uninteresting.
Once in every two or three miles a single farmhouse
appears, surrounded by half a dozen dwarf cherry trees.
Such an assemblage is a wood on Nantucket, where there
is not a tree of native growth. We dined with Dr. and Mrs.
Easton.”</p>
</div>


<p class="hanging">1807—A writer, under date of Aug. 1, 1807,
 (<abbr title="Massachusetts Historical Society Collection">Mass. Hist.
Soc. Coll.</abbr>) states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The town stands on the west side of the harbour and
is a mile and a half in length and a third of a mile in breadth.
It contains 850 dwelling houses (including 15 at Podpis,
Quayz, Squam, etc.) 63 stores, a great number of shops,
besides candle works, rope walks, etc., five wharves and five
windmills. The town, with exception of one or two houses, is
built of wood. The houses are generally two stories in height;
some of them have clapboards in front; but the greatest part
of them are covered with shingles. Several of them are
painted green. They are convenient buildings, but there is
not much elegance in their appearance.”</p>

<p>Later on in his notes, he states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“House lots in the town sell for from $100 to $200 a
square rod; rents are low, few exceeding $100 a year. The
greatest part of the houses are owned by those who live in
them. The present number of inhabitants is estimated at
6730.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“The Nantucket stores and houses are built of timber,

are mostly painted red or white and are crowned by the
steeples, or rather towers, of two Presbyterian meeting
houses. Several new streets have been laid out in straight
lines and a number of houses have been built within a year
or two with ceilings of 10 feet high. This, however, is considered
a piece of useless extravagance, the old-fashioned
stories of eight or nine feet being generally reckoned high
enough, and to spare. Every other house in this seafaring
place has a lookout upon the roof or a vane at the gable end;
to see what ships have arrived from sea or whether the wind
is fair for the packets.”</p>

<p class="hanging">1850 (before and after)—</p>

<p>Joseph E. C. Farnham was born in Nantucket in 1849. He
was a keen observer of the people of the Island and their
customs and wrote at considerable length “Brief Historical
Data and Memories of My Boyhood Days at Nantucket.” It
delightfully describes the town at the close of the whaling era.</p>

<p>Worth observes that “the gambrel-roofed house never
attracted the attention of the Nantucket people. The few that
are still standing were erected after 1750. After the Revolution,
when prosperity dawned on the Island, the common
type of house was the square two-story structure, with large
center chimney, numerous examples of which are to be seen.
The same regard for ancient houses has also led people
to retain the large center chimney. While in many towns
desire for increased room or for the appearance of a small
chimney has led house owners to replace the old structure
with one greatly inferior in size, at Nantucket the disposition
has prevailed to keep without change this distinguishing mark
of the 18th century construction.”</p>

<p class="hanging">1876—Nantucket after the end of the whaling, at its lowest
ebb. Read “Nooks and Corners of the New England
Coast” by S. A. Drake.</p>

<p class="hanging">1882—This date is early in a new period of prosperity due
to the summer visitors. The back log and fore log of
this growing and practically only sizeable remaining
“industry” are now the owners and renters of houses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Visitors used to come for a “vacation” of a few days or
weeks, but now they stay the season or longer. Read
“Island of Nantucket, What It Was and What It Is”
by E. K. Godfrey.</p>

<p class="hanging">1924—From an article by Walter Prichard Eaton:</p>

<p>Individually, and in the mass, the architecture of old
Nantucket was and is extraordinarily dignified in its quiet
simplicity and nice proportions, and often really exquisite in
its use of ornamental detail.</p>

<p>Nearly every other American town, once rich in
Eighteenth or early Nineteenth Century architecture, has
been injured by the intermingling of later buildings, but by
a curious set of economic chances, old Nantucket has almost
entirely escaped, and remains today architecturally much as
it was when the crest of the whaling prosperity enabled the
islanders to build it more than a century ago.</p>

<p>Then came sophisticated moderns, and the best these
moderns could do were hideous casinos, sprawling cottages
with verandas stuck all over them helter-skelter, houses with
broken and meaningless roof lines, windows badly spaced
and without style, ornamentation without dignity, gingerbread
trimmings and nothing, anywhere, that had repose,
unity, beauty of outline, or even adaptability to its site.</p>

<p>The Puritans of Nantucket left behind no poems or
plays, but to say they left behind no art is ridiculous. They
left behind an entire town which is a work of art, in its way
as charming and as nearly perfect as anything in the Old
World, and utterly different from anything in the Old World—a
unique expression. They were able to do this because,
to them, art was expressed through the crafts, and every man
who used a tool (which meant almost every man) was an
artist.</p>
